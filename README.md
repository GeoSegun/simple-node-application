## ‚ú® Introduction
This project demonstrates deploying a simple Node.js application on an AWS EC2 instance using Terraform for infrastructure as code (IaC).

### Features:
- Infrastructure provisioning with Terraform.
- Amazon Linux 2 AMI setup with Node.js and Git.
- Secure SSH and HTTP configurations with AWS Security Groups.

## üèó Architecture Overview
The architecture is designed as follows:

![Architecture Diagram](images/youtube-first.JPG)

### Key Components:
- **Terraform**: To define and provision the AWS infrastructure.  
- **AWS EC2**: Hosts the Node.js application.  
- **AWS Security Groups**: Ensures secure access via SSH and HTTP.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### Pre-requisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Terraform** (v1.5 or above)  
- **AWS CLI**  
- **Git**  

You also need:
- An AWS account.  
- An SSH key pair for accessing the EC2 instance.

### Provisioning the Infrastructure

1. Fork and clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/simple-node-application.git
cd simple-node-application/terraform
```

2. Set Environment Variables
Export your AWS credentials and SSH key:

```bash
export TF_VAR_aws_access_key="your-access-key"
export TF_VAR_aws_secret_key="your-secret-key"
export TF_VAR_key_name="your-ssh-key"
```

3. Update the Terraform Configuration

- Modify the ami value in main.tf to match your desired Amazon Linux 2 AMI.
- Replace the GitHub URL in user_data with your forked repository URL.

4. Initialize Terraform

```bash
terraform init
```

5. Inspect the Plan

```bash
terraform plan
```

6. Apply the Configuration:

```bash
terraform apply
```

7. Access the Application

- Note the EC2 instance's public IP address from the Terraform output.
- Open a browser and navigate to http://<instance-public-ip>:3000 to access the app.
